    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a 
    definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which developers gain an understanding of the requirements the customer is requesting of them."

const design = "This is the third step, developers outline many of the large features of the software such as languages used, how users interact with the software, and how the program communicates with previously implemented software."

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which developers take all their design plans and write the code so the software matches the requirements of the customers. Larger projects will be split up across many developers on a team."

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, developers begin testing their written software and allowing for the customer to begin using it. The softare may first be released to a smaller number of users to find any issues before it is made available to all the intended users."

const maintain = "This is the final step, issues or bugs may go unnoticed in the testing and integration phases, which will prompt the developers to begin a new Software Development Lifecyle so that the software can best serve the users."
